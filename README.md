# Week-8-Data-Science-Core-IP-
This is an individual project undertaken as a requirement for completion of Wee 8's Data Science content in Moringa School.
The task for this week was to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid and I was provided with a dataset from Nairobi hospital conducted on patients who had throid disease.
I therefore went ahead to utilize the concepts learnt during the week(Decision trees and Support Vector Machines) to develop the models and determine which one serves the purpose best.
